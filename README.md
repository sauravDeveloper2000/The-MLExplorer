## The MLExplorer

The MLExplorer is an Machine Learning based app, in which user can recognize Europian Landmarks and can do Object Detection and Tracking.
## Tech Stack

#### Securityüîê
- Implemented Firebase Authentication feature to develop Login and Registration Screen. So that only authenticated user can access the app.

#### Dependency Injection üíâ
- Implement Dagger Hilt Library to manage component Dependencies.

#### Navigation üß≠
- Implement JetPack Compose Navigation Library to handle app Navigation, make app multi screen level.

#### UI
- Built the UI using JetPack Compose toolkit adhered by Material 3 guidelines. 

#### Language 
- Kotlin to built backend logic.
#### Tools 
- Android Studio FrameWork

#### Other Tech Stack
- Implemented CameraX Library to access Device Camera component.


## Models:

### Euro Landmark Recognition 
- For europian landmark recognition I have integerated the tensorflow lite model which classifies or recognizes the europian landmark.

### Object Detection and Tracking
- For Object Detection and Tracking I have integerated the EfficientDet-Lite0 model. Why?
- Because it strikes a balance between latency and accuracy. It is both accurate and lightweight enough for many use cases.

## Other Information

- Now this app is not open for further contribution.
- And the Why its name is "The MLExplorer". Because the main motive behind developing this app is that I want to explore the ML field, I want to get an idea, an learning that how to integrate an Pre-Train model into an Android App. And what I can do with these models.
- So that's why I have named it The MLExplorer.
